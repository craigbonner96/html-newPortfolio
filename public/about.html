<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome! My name is Craig Bonner, and I am an aspiring software developer currently employed
  by NatWest Group. I previously studied Accountancy and Finance at the University of Glasgow, and
  subsequently worked at KPMG LLP for 4 years in the Global Mobility Tax department. I am a qualified
  Chartered Accountant (CA) with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS), and also
  a Chartered Tax Advisor (CTA) with the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT).

<p>I am now pursuing a career change into software development, and plan to upload any projects which
  I have been working in to this website.

<p>Thank you!</p>
