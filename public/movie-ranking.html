<h1>The Greatest Films of All Time</h1>
<h2>Craig's Top 3;</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is truly the best film of all time. The acting, story, and direct are unrivalled.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The best film from the best trilogy ever.</p>
<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>I would never have thought that I would include a musical in my top 3 films, but La La Land deserves it. Fantastic story and incredible soundtrack.</p>
